# Selenium Java Automation Testing Framework

> **Selenium** is an open-source automation tool used for testing web applications across different browsers. It allows developers and testers to automate browser actions like clicking, typing, and navigating web pages. Selenium supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript, and is widely used for functional, regression, and cross-browser testing. Its flexibility and extensive browser compatibility make it a popular choice for automating web-based testing.

> **TestNG** is a testing framework for Java that is designed to simplify test automation. It provides powerful features such as annotations, parallel test execution, data-driven testing, and detailed reporting. TestNG is widely used for unit, functional, and integration testing, offering greater control over test case management and execution compared to JUnit. It also allows for easier grouping and prioritization of test cases, making it a popular choice in automated testing environments.

> **Cucumber** is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework that allows developers and testers to write test cases in a natural language format (Gherkin). It bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members by enabling the creation of test scenarios that are easy to understand. Cucumber automates functional testing and integrates with various programming languages, such as Java, Ruby, and JavaScript, making it a versatile tool for writing clear, readable, and maintainable automated test scripts.
